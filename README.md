# react-ui-demo
Demo of UI built using React.js.

Uses Gulp and Webpack to compile and bundle JSX into JS.

Files are served from an Express web server.

To run it:

1. First run `npm install` to get all dependencies.
2. If you don't already have `gulp` installed, run `npm install gulp --global` or simply `npm i -g gulp`.
3. Use `gulp` to compile the JS and copy it to the public directory using `gulp js-update`.
4. Run the server using `npm start`.
5. Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser (or 'Preview Running Application' in Cloud9).
